# Alice's Restaurant Repo

## What?
This repository is home to various analyses and methodologies applied to the `tips` dataset. 

## Content and Questions
- `explore.ipynb` contains exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and documented takeaways
- `prep.py` that splits, scales, and encodes all the features
- Decision Tree example
- Random Forest example
- k-Nearest-Neighbors example
- Logistic Regression example
- Linear Regression example for:
    - predicting tips
    - predicting total_bill
- "Holding everything else constant" examples
- How much does scaling continuous values improve model performance?


## Some questions
- Are the sex, smoker, day, and time features good predictors of bill_per_capita?
- Are these features good predictors of tip_per_capita?

- Are smoking tables better tippers?
- Do smoking tables have higher bills or not?

- Is gender of the billpayer a predictor of bill or tip?
- Is the time of day a predictor of bill or tip?
- etc...
